CallBack help get values after call method.
How it work?
In method "call", provider object must be override method of this object (normal abstract method
and has parameter is value return of "call").
This methods have been call in "call" with arguments are value return of "call".

Call async: in "call", start new thread.
In java, not redefind constructor, and not use method as arguments of method, not as javascript.

In java, can force main thread waiting child thread finish by wait and notify.
    synchronized (check) {
			check.wait();
			System.out.println("Finish!");
		}
    synchronized (check) {
      check.notifyAll();		
    }
